Geo::PostalAddress - Country-specific postal address parsing/formatting

DESCRIPTION

This module converts postal (snail mail) addresses between an
unstructured country-neutral format (an array of character strings)
and a country-specific format that's hopefully meaningful by postal
authorities, courier/delivery services, residents, ... of that
country for postal address entry. It should handle most countries 
out of the box with only minor or technical divergences from 
approved bulk-mailing formats; if needed, country-specific code can 
be added to make it fully conformant to those formats.

The intended audience for this module is anyone needing to handle
most addresses in a recognizable country-specific format, without
going into the full generality and complexity that UPU standards
would appear to require.
